## My Person Website

This is my developer portfolio. I've deployed it, even though it's sort of not ready yet :) alas, that's just life. I've really enjoyed this project, and it's the first project I've deployed on my own, albeit through gh-pages.

You can follow my progress on Trello at the link below.

If you have any issues please submit an issue and I'll fix it ASAP. If you have any questions, also submit an issue as well. Thanks!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
